                         The OverC Installer
                         -------------------

A collection of scripts which are used to assemble the output of a
meta-overc build (kernel, rootfs, containers) into an installer image
(capable of performing an install) or live image.

Dependencies:
-------------

The cube* installer has the following dependencies:

 - oci-runtime-tool: git://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools.git
 - cube-cfg: git://github.com/OverC/meta-overc.git
 - cubt-ctl: git://github.com/OverC/meta-overc.git
 - jq

oci-runtime-tool has been built and checked into this repository as a
static binary; therefore, there is nothing to do for this depencency.

cube-cfg/cube-ctl should be placed in the sbin/ directory of this repo
and kept up to date with meta-overc development. To aid this, a github
fetch script is provided. 

To place these two scripts (Assuming the master-oci branch in this example):

 % ./lib/github-fetcher.py -b master-oci OverC meta-overc meta-cube/recipes-support/overc-utils/source/cube-cfg sbin/
 % ./lib/github-fetcher.py -b master-oci OverC meta-overc meta-cube/recipes-support/overc-utils/source/cube-ctl sbin/
 % chmod +x sbin/cube-ctl
 % chmod +x sbin/cube-cfg

Note: if a branch other than master is needed, use the -b <branch> parameter
      to the fetcher.

Usage:
